clout
### Meaning
+ _noun_: power and influence
	+ __eg__: political/financial clout
+ _noun_: (informal) a blow with the hand or a hard object
	+ __eg__:  You're not too big for a clout round the ear!

+ _vt_: to hit sb hard, especially with your hand

### Origin

Old English clūt (in the sense ‘a patch or metal plate’); related to Dutch kluit ‘lump, clod’, also to ↑cleat and ↑clot. The shift of sense to ‘heavy blow’, which dates from late Middle English, is difficult to explain; possibly the change occurred first in the verb (from ‘put a patch on’ to ‘hit hard’).
