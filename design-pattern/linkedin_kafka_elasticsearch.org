* kafka & elastic search

** What is journal
    log = data + timestamp
    
** Why logging system

   1) Search

** logging analysis sytem
   Index, search, sort, cluster, visualize, analyse
   Extend by scale
   cross-datacenter
   support enhancement, conecting to other system
   1) System sustainablity
   2) Stability, user info protection
   3) Sampling, or logging everything

** From
   ?? ~ 2012 Splunk, good to use but expensive.
   2014 ~ 2015 ELK, opensource, ElasticSearch Logstash Kibana

** Why not this
   Logstash Agent maintainence, Daemon, and jvm memory

** Main Log standardize
   Java service, 15 + log
   access log
   Java Container Logger

   V2: Kafka ES Logstash Kibana

** V2 problem:
   ELK Cluster, stop intervene
   Logstash ES separation
   make good partition under kafka

** V3 problem
   inter-service searching
   inter-datacenter searching -> ES cannot handle.

** Tribe? no layering.

** V4 problem, SLOW.
