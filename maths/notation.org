* Set Theory
** Cantorian Set Theory
  1) A set may consist of any distinguishable objects
  2) A set is unambiguously determined by the collection of objects that comprise it
  3) Any property defines the set of objects having that property

** If $$ x $$ is an object, $$ P $$ is a property, and $$ P(x) $$ denotes the assertion that $$ x $$ has property P, then the class of objects is denoted $$ \{x|P(x)\} $$
